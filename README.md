For Developers: Streamline Your Workflow with AI

## Pain Point
As developers, we're all too familiar with the constant juggling between Slack messages and the nagging question: "Did I reply? Is there something urgent I need to reply to?" On top of that, there's the inefficiency of higher-ups asking for project updates that are readily available in Jira. These distractions hinder our focus and productivity.

## Our Solution
We're building an open-source Python-based solution that employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with OpenAI agents to address these exact challenges. 

Our project aims to:
- Equip an agent with Jira and Slack tools to automatically manage communications and highlight urgent messages.
- Leverage cutting-edge AI tools from OpenAI to streamline workflows and enhance decision-making processes.
